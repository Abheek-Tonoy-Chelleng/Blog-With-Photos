            <p>Molai Forest located in the Jorhat district of Assam is the outcome of the constant hard work put in by a famous environmentalist named Jadev Molai Payeng. He has done a phenomenal work of planting in 1360 acres of land within a time of 30 years and that too single-handedly. He started with a very small step of planting trees on the bank of the River Brahmaputra which later on turned into a huge forest area giving home to several wildlife creatures. It is truly delightful to visit this Mulai Forest when you are at Jorhat and it shows how beautiful our surroundings can be if we have greenery around us. This man-made forest has become a famous tourist attraction of the state. You can see here the Indian rhinoceros, Bengal tigers, rabbits, deer and a wide variety of birds. Another exceptional feature of this forest is that it is regular visited by herds of elephant that stay here for six months. As a result of this about 10 elephant calves have taken birth in this forest.</p>
